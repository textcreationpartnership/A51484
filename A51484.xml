            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Suppoſe it will be no hard matter for you to diſcover from what Soil this plant originally comes. It was indeed, wholly French within theſe few weeks, and there were not many months, ſince it appeared in <hi>France.</hi> I will not ſay that it may poſſbly find a more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reception, as coming from that place,
<pb facs="tcp:43578:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>from whence we ſo frequently receive thoſe new Modes we ſo highly value and admire. But yet I may perchance with ſome reaſon, hope, that it may not be unwelcome to ſome, who may take notice of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Method</hi> wholly ſuited to that civility and Peaceable way of proceeding, which I have heard the beſt bred and moſt moderate perſons require in things of this nature. The chief intended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this ſmall Treatiſe, is, in order to a clearing the Point of the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> in the moſt Bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt, the principal ſubject of Conteſts now at preſent in thoſe parts. Though (as the Authour in his laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter makes evidently appear) <hi>mutatis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis</hi> it is equally appliable to any other matter whatſoever. I pray be not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if I ſay that it has often been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon by very ſober men, that thoſe of the adverſe Party deal not fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us, ſcarce ever allowing us to enter into Dispute with them upon equal terms.</p>
            <p>For we being tyed up and incloſed as it were, within certain limits, which keep our underſtandings (as well as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb facs="tcp:43578:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>incloſures are not to reſtrain our bodies) within a certain compaſſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and opining, it is very eaſie at any time, and upon any ſubject belonging to Faith, to know where to find us. I mean to be at a certainty of what we are obliged to maintain, and where we may be ſet upon.</p>
            <p>It would have ſaved us ſome labour, if we could alwayes have been ſure to have had the ſame advantage, and that there were not thoſe alterations and that variety of Opinions in the Times, Places, and Perſons of the Reformed Churches, which very frequently put us upon a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of coming unprepared of ſuitable Arms offenſive or defenſive, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to have ſufficient intelligence beforehand of the nature of our enemy or of his manner of fight.</p>
            <p>In the Subject matter of Diſpute (concerning the Bleſſed Sacrament) I know there are ſome who will not ſtick to ſay roundly, that it is nothing but Bread and Wine which is contained and Received in the Lords Supper. And theſe, I think, ſpeak the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:43578:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Engliſh;</hi> that is, expreſs moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincerely in their words, what they do believe in their judgements Others think this too rough and harſh, as claſhing too openly with Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (the Rule of Belief) and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sentiment and Language of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. And theſe will tell you, though ſomething faintly; that <hi>Chriſt is truly preſent,</hi> that <hi>he is really preſent,</hi> that <hi>he is there the Food of the Soul, and the Bread of Angels.</hi> In a word, they will expreſſe themſelves in ſuch terms, with ſo much reſpect and reverence of that Holy Sacrament, that you ſhall have much adoe to diſtinguiſh them from true and hearty <hi>Catholicks.</hi> But yet if you preſſe them to ſpeak intelligibly and to declare candidly what they mean by <hi>Truely</hi> and <hi>Really,</hi> you ſhall find that (though they are loath to ſpeak out) they mean nothing leſſe then what thoſe words in their natural uſe ſeem to import. For <hi>Truely</hi> and <hi>Really</hi> muſt come to ſignifie onely <hi>figuratively</hi> and <hi>Commemoratively,</hi> or ſome ſuch like.</p>
            <p>And whereas, by the expreſſions they
<pb facs="tcp:43578:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>are pleaſed to make uſe of, you might, in reaſon, expect ſomething of <hi>Real</hi> Substance diſtinct from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ſons fetched as far as Senſe and Natural Philoſophy can reach, to oblige you to believe that in this great ſupernatural Work of the Hand of the Omnipotent, in which he undertook to act the Wonder of Wonders; the whole Change is made by, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in <hi>Faith onely.</hi> Nay, their <hi>Real</hi> Faith is, that there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>her: Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Mutation in the matter or ſubject of this great Sacrament, but what is made in the fancy by them called Faith. I know there are near as many ſeveral Opinions concerning the content of this Holy Sacrament, as there are explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe words which make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> which have been calculated by ſome, curious in this kind, to a very incredible Product.</p>
            <p>And now it being left to every one to take up what and which he pleaſes in this great variety of Opinions, I think
<pb facs="tcp:43578:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>we have reaſon to ſay we have a hard task to oppoſe we know not what, till we come to the Tryal; or defend our ſelves againſt I cannot tell whom (<hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran, Calviniſt, Anabaptiſt, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,</hi> &amp;c.) till they are pleaſed to declare themſelves and appoint us our Theme.</p>
            <p>But that for which I am to commend and recommend this enſuing Diſcourſe, is, that I think it equally and ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing againſt all. For if it be once made out (as this Treatiſe endeavours to evince even by the conſent of the whole Reformed Church it ſelf) that there muſt intervene ſome Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which may exact an acquieſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and withall are obliged to ſubmit unto without further diſpute, there will quickly be diſcovered a ready way to put things into a better poſture: and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars will find whereon to ſettle, as in one Center, that unlimitted variety of opining.</p>
            <p>I beſeech thoſe who have a real kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for their own Souls, and any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for thoſe who were accounted great
<pb facs="tcp:43578:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>Perſons, even in their own way, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect particularly upon what is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſecond Chapter of this little Work, concerning the Opinions of the Divines of all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> in this Point; and eſpecially upon what was delivered at the famous Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> by the Embaſſadour, and by the Commiſſion of the Great and VViſe King, King <hi>James: That there was but one onely means, which the Church had ever made uſe of: to wit, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synod, which was to be Judge in the caſe, and to decide which of the two Opinions, was more conformable to the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>I know there are ſome who hold all theſe proceedings and practiſes very harſh and unreaſonable, whoſe ſpirits will not eaſily yield but will make bold to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the caſe with Kings or Councils, Parliaments or Prelates, or any thing which agrees not with their private and particular Principles. And they will tell you (very colourably as they imagine) that as their Soul is their own, and as they muſt ſtand or fall to themſelves, ſo are they to make choice of their own faith and Religion, and not to pin it upon another mans ſleeve. I ſhould ſomthing wonder to bear an Objection of this nature from any one who pretends to Learning. But becauſe I know there are ſome who make plauſible flouriſhes upon it, and think by this means to caſt off all Authority, and become their own

And yet, Gentlemen, thus far I will keep you company: that your Soul is your own (under the great Giver of it) and that you muſt ſtand or fall to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>But I fear you have never been at any of the Univerſities, or not minded the buſineſſe your Parents intended by the charge they were at, if you think this good Logick: <hi>Ergo, you are to chooſe your own Faith;</hi> in that ſence which is and muſt be intended by you, if you think to evade what will here come in againſt you. For your meaning (if at all to your purpoſe) can be no other, but that becauſe your Soul is your own, and you your ſelf, and no body elſe, are to give an account of your ſteward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and your improving of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:43578:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>you are to make up a Faith (which indeed is the Ground of all ſubſequent action) according to your own fancy and underſtanding.

            <p>But I muſt needs tell you, what I have heard ſome very Learned and expert Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
<pb facs="tcp:43578:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>complain of, which is: That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times it happens that ſome good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having by friendſhip or ſtealth, gotten ſome Preſcription of theirs, which had been found very beneficial to ſome Patient or other, applyes it ſo ill, and ſo irregularly, for want of knowledge of the nature of Diſtempers, or of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Bodies, or of the Criſis of the Diſeaſe &amp;c. that in ſtead of a Cure by that excellent Remedy, which with due application wrought ſtrange effects in ſome, it comes to be the ruine of many a poor Creature who under a skilful hand had been in little or no danger at all. To be a little bold with you then: I pray tell me; have you confidence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption enough to think you have (in a matter of greater moment) the skill you pretend to? VVere you ſick of ſome dangerous diſeaſe, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your Life were your own, and that no body were to live by you or dye with you, yet I dare boldly ſay you would be loath (it would be against the practice, cuſtome, and even obligation of the ablest Phyſicians in the world) to rely upon your own judgement, but would be glad, even with ſome charge, to have
<pb facs="tcp:43578:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>the advice of one or more, who had made it their buſineſs to study nature, and were approved of as men well verſed in the Art of Phyſick. VVere you to make a Purchaſe never ſo inconſiderable, yet I preſume, (though the Estate were to come and belong to none but your ſelf and your heirs) you would think it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to employ ſome Learned man in the Law to draw the Conveyance and make your Title ſure. And herein I think conſiſts the chief and ſum of your skill, to make a prudent choice of ſuch perſons in both Arts as you may ſafely rely upon, and to follow their order and directions, if you intend either to recover your Health or ſecure your Inheritance. And can you think it a buſineſs of leſſe importance, in an affair of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern as is the election of your Faith and Religion, to make a good and prudent choyce of thoſe who are both by Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and Divine Authority enabled to guide and direct you in the wayes of Truth?</p>
            <p>I leave you to a more ſerious reflexion and more mature deliberation upon this great buſineſſe, as you ſhall find your

For in theſe, for the moſt part, after a Battel or two, the Victory is clear on one ſide or other, and Peace is again eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the defeat of him who finds himſelf in a neceſſity of yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fate of War, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law from the Conquering Party. But in that other, the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Champion of Errour even after many foils and defeat, does ſtill ſcorn to yield the victory. Nay, I dare be bold to ſay, he will not fail to become more violent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent than ever; becauſe he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to want the boldneſs to ſpeak as high and as loud as Truth it ſelf, and to make himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve he has right to challenge the victory on his ſide, which perchance may appear, at leaſt, doubtful to the greateſt part of the hearers in the heat and noiſe of Diſputation.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not this as diſowning that proceeding by way of diſputation to have been of great advantage to

Yet this I think we may be bold to affirm, that this Method, be it never ſo excellent in it ſelf, is not apt to produce thoſe happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in all perſons univerſally; it being more proper for the Learned only. And as it happens that the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Adverſaries of Truth is alwayes accompanied with blindneſs and obſtinacy (the proper effects of that Pride which gives it its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended magnitude) ſo comes it to paſs, that that light which ariſes from Diſpute, proves very uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in order to a reducing of them; and ſerves, for the moſt part, onely to make the breach wider, and to maintain the unhappy war, ſo as to render it more laſting, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner endleſs.</p>

               <p>Nay, it hath fallen our more than once, that that very Perſon for whoſe ſatisfaction a Conference hath been held, or a Treatiſe written, perceiving no great advantage gotten by the conteſt, has found himſelf in a wavering condition, and has thought it not unreaſonable to begin to call that now in queſtion, of which before he made no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>This is the very reaſon why this Learned man concludes,

This ſeems to me the onely means to end this endleſs war: to bring the buſineſs home to ſome one of thoſe Principles which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and allowed of on both ſides, and are agreed upon as the chief Rule for deciding all our differences.

That which the one does moſt juſtly, in exprobating fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and error unto his adverſary, the other thinks moſt unjuſtly done, and declares againſt it. Truth, which onely has reaſon to uſe ſuch language, finds it ſelf ſet upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, even after Victory. And Falſity, which diſguiſes it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Verity, and uſurps her right, begins again to fight her at her own weapon, uttering the ſame or like reproaches againſt her.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This appears particularly in the proceeding of the Proteſtant Party, who, upon their ſeparation from us, thought good to accuſe us of error and novelty. It is ſcarce to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved how many ſet Diſputations and Conferences there have been held both in publick and in private; concerning Points in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. The number of thoſe Volumes which have been writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe ſubjects, would ſerve to fill whole Liberaries. What paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages have not <hi>Bellarmin, Perron, Coëf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feteau, Richelieu,</hi> and thoſe other famous Defenders of the Faith,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43578:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>drawn out of the Holy Scriptures; and Antient Fathers, together with all the Reaſons and Arguments which might ſerve to place Truth again in its proper light, and reſtore unto it the luſtre which Falſity had endeavoured to rob her of? I ſpeak this, becauſe for my own part, I am highly ſatisfied, that the Proofs which theſe great men have made uſe of, are of very great force, and their Diſcourſes very exact and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; and that the Church of God owes much unto them for their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and induſtrie in maintaining her juſt Decrees.</p>
               <p>I will add ſomething more yet. I have ſo good an opinion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ingenuity and honeſty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the moſt ſincere and witty perſons of the Proteſtant party them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (for there are certainly, in other reſpects, many excellent Wits and Learned men amongſt them) that they will not make much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to own candidly and plainly, that the Reaſons and Places which our Doctors have alledged againſt their Tenets, have put them very much to it, and that they have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43578:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>need enough of all their Wit, all their ſhifts, and all their induſtry to diſengage themſelves, in ſome hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome appearance at leaſt, from ſuch ſtreights as thoſe troubleſom paſſages have brought them into.</p>
               <p>And now as I have taken the freedom to deſire them to deal can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly with me, ſo is it my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be plain and ſincere with them; and to yield ſo far unto them, as ingeniouſly to acknowledge, that in thoſe Anſwers of theirs, with which, in their turns, they have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led large Volumes, they are not without ſome colourable pretence, and that they carry ſuch an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Reaſon with them, as may eaſily ſeduce the underſtandings of thoſe who are not well verſed in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of this nature. Nay, I will own farther, that ſome paſſages out of Scripture, and the Holy Fathers; alledged by them againſt us, have obliged us to make uſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moufeſt Wits amongſt us, to find a clear and natural ſenſe in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, which has not been of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to hinder theſe men from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Replyes, that they may ſtill

               <p>Thus after ſo many aſſaults, and ſo many repulſes; after ſo many brave Works of thoſe great men, who have: ſo gallantly maintained the Churches cauſe, our adverſaries will not at all own themſelves weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby.

On the contrary he makes it appear, that in thoſe very dayes, in which this ſtrange Innovation is pretended to have been brought into the world, this Doctrine of ours was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belief of the whole Church, which had alſo received it from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages. And this he ſhews by an exact inquiry into all the Authors of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church, who lived from the ſeventh unto the tenth Age (which is the time they

Nay, he endeavours to lay down the very manner how this came to paſs; at ſuch time as the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43578:20"/>Church was fallen off from that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and diſtinct knowledge of the truth of this great Myſtery, into a more confuſed and general belief o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And being far from giving ground upon the laſt piece which was ſet out againſt him, and upon which a finall Concluſion of the difference was to be hoped, it is commonly reported, that he is already prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enter again into the Liſt with more earneſtneſs and reſolution the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For making uſe of all the Art and Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty humane Wit affords (which is alwayes ſufficiently furniſhed with

In a word, he runs quite counter to him in every thing; denying (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> has it) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his Adverſary maintains, and maintaining whatever he denies. So true it is, that it being once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to yield in ſuch kind of encounters, there will never be wanting matter for Diſpute, even in ſuch things which otherwiſe appear evident and uncontroulable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I make no doubt but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Learned Work of <hi>the Peertuity, &amp;c.</hi> will be able to ſtand his ground, and to gain yet more, with the ſame advantage which ſo good a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43578:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>Cauſe has hitherto afforded him. The honour which is gotten by the happy mannaging ſuch Diſputes is proper for thoſe Great Wits and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons, who take ſuch pains, chiefly for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who have the ſame abilities. For this cauſe, as I dare not pretend to make one of that number; having no other aim in this my undertaking but to ſerve thoſe who hold not themſelves obliged to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trouble of tedious ſearches into <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authors, ſo do I willingly and entirely give up that Honour unto him, and make choice rather of another Method, inferiour indeed in outward ſhew, but much more eaſy, and, at the leaſt, full as profitable, if I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end of my endeavours, which is, to reduce Proteſtants by a ſweeter way and without conteſt.</p>
               <p>For this end it will be neceſſary, as we have already infin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To this end I am reſolved to alledge nothing in this little Treatiſe, but what Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> himſelf is pleaſed to grant us, and what our Adverſaries themſelves make uſe of for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing their Pretenſes. Although ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſpeaking (as I touched before) there is not any thing which is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to exceptions, cavils, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious wranglings even in things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt evident, ſuppoſing a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſtinately to defend a Party enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for, and that it comes to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Point of Honour ſo to do. I cannot, for all that, underſtand how that can again be queſtioned, which has once been granted, and of which they have, at another time, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make their own advantage. So that I cannot well fear leſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which I ſhall advance, ſhould fall under that conteſt, which I ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly endeavour to eſchew. For in the eſtabliſhing of it, and in applying of it

               <p>In the firſt I will propoſe the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime or Principle which I intend to make uſe of, and I will eſtabliſh it by the Doctrine and proceedings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtants themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond I will apply it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own Rules, unto the Subject of the Holy Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>And in the laſt I will draw thoſe Conſequences, which their own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed-upon Principles do afford me.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to me the way to force our Adverſaries (but ſweetly) to return of themſelves, to that True Faith, from which a miſerable Schiſme has unfortunately ſeparated them, by

               <p>I am not able to ſay what ſucceſs I am like to have in ſo noble an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The ſettling of this general Maxime: That that Church in which are found the two Parties concern'd has ever had the Power to determine all differences, and to declare that as matter of Faith which before there was no obligation to believe. And that we are bound to acquieſce unto her deciſions, under the penalty of being Schiſmaticks.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THere is not any one to be ſound among thoſe, who bear the name of Chriſtians, who does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there is in the World a True Church, which our Lord Jeſus has purchaſed with the price of his own moſt pretious Blood. All thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43578:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>who have ſeparated themſelves from us into ſo many ſeveral Sects, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that their Congregation is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Faithful, and the Church of God, agree at leaſt in this, that they hold for certain, that there is a True Church of Jeſus Chriſt, whereſoever it is to be found.</p>
               <p>It is moreover evident, that thoſe who firſt entred into Diſpute concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters of Faith, were all of the ſame Church; which Church before it did declare for either ſide of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and before one Party made a ſeparation, was the onely then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſequently the True Church.</p>
               <p>Now of this Church it is I intend to ſpeak: and I averr, that all general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do agree, that She is endowed with Soveraign Authority to define and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that as matter of Faith, which, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to her definition, no body per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance was obliged to accept under that notion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For proof of this Verity, which is not well to be denied, when underſtood, this reflexion is to be made out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, Chap.</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:43578:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>10: That to be bound to believe a thing as a Point of Faith, it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that it be contained in the Word of God, which is the onely motive of divine Faith, but it is alſo neceſſary that we know it, and that we know it as revealed by God. For to know it, we muſt hear of it; and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (regularly ſpeaking) it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that it be propoſed by full Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the formal words of the bleſſed Apoſtle do clearly import.</p>

                  </gap>icle of Faith; and this cannot be without the Miniſtry of thoſe who are appointed by the Church to propoſe her Doctrine, which Doctrine is grounded upon the Word of God. In regard of this the Apoſtle concludes in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Faith then is by hearing, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is by the Word of Chriſt.</hi> Thus for there is no difference betwixt us and Proteſtants. They do own, that for this end, it is neceſſary there ſhould be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43578:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Church, Miniſters of the Word of God, for the propoſing, by her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that which is contained in the Divine Word. They profeſs, that in order to an obligation of believing any particular point, it is neceſſary that it be diſtinctly known, and that it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſome legal Authority to be believed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This notwithſtanding, there are many things which we are now obliged to believe, which were not diſtinctly known at ſome other time, nor propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto the Faithful as Points belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Faith, and neceſſarily to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by them. It is a verity which no Proteſtant, I think, will make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in.</p>
               <p>For I will now grant them, that all that we are to believe is contained in the Word of God, which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Holy Scriptures, and which the bleſſed Apoſtles have delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, having firſt received it of their Divine Maſter Chriſt Jeſus. But I hope alſo they will not ſtick to acknowledge, that all that is comprehended in Holy Writ, whether in the ſence of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or in the Conſequences which are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43578:25"/>included in thoſe Divine Principles, has not alwayes been clearly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by all perſons, and at all times. It is an admirable ſure of Tapiſtry wrought by the hand of God himſelf, and framed with a moſt rare variety of gracefull figures, both for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and inſtruction of his Church; but it was not, from the beginning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all at once to view. Theſe rare lineaments did not appear but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as it happened that the pieces were unfolded one after another upon occaſions.</p>
               <p>It is a moſt fertile ſoil which bears a marvellous variety of ſweet flowers, of excellent fruit, and all ſorts of choice grain in its bowells, as it were incloſed or ſhut up in the ſeeds, which are as ſo many Treaſures with which ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched: but you muſt expect till the Sun diſcloſe and diſcover them, making them ſpring and bud forth one after a not her according to their ſundry ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to the end that they may beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and adorne the Fields and Gardens.</p>
               <p>It is a Heaven decked with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit variety of glittering Stars, which ſparkle and make a kind of day in ſpight
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43578:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the darkneſs of night; but their glory does then only appear, when the Moon has by little and little diſſipated the vapours and clouds which keep them from our ſight.</p>
               <p>Even ſo the Word of God compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all vetities belonging to Faith. But thoſe fair flowers did not appear, thoſe bright Stars did not ſhine to the eyes of Chriſtians, until the light of the Holy Ghoſt illuminating his Church, did; by it ſelf, upon occaſion, diſſipate thoſe clouds which hid thoſe glorious Stars from our eyes: or diſcloſed and brought to light thoſe rare flowers, by conſequences drawn out of certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in which they before remained, as it were, ſhut up or incloſed.</p>

All which are now no more to be called in queſtion, although before the definition of the Church, it might have been done without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>For if it be true, that it belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her to propoſe that as matter of Faith, which was not before diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly known or taken under that notion, as we have now made out; it muſt

               <p>This makes it further more manifeſt, that it cannot be ſaid, that the Decrees of Synods are onely Rules of Policy, which do not reach unto Doctrine; and only ſerve for exterior order, which is the utmoſt limit of their authority

It cannot then be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but this Synod pretended to the ſame thing, and that by declaring that the Doctrine of the <hi>Arminians</hi> was full of errors and contrary to the Word of God, they intended to ſay an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of renouncing the ſaid Doctrine, by ſubſcribing to their Decrees, that they might not become guilty of Schiſme and Hereſie. But without any great neceſſity of reaſoning the buſineſs, it is but hearing how the Synod delivers it ſelf upon this ſubject.

               <p>The firſt is: That as the Word of God is infallible in it ſelf, ſo certainly the Judgement of him, who truely judges according to this Rule, is alſo Infallible: and conſequently, they are obliged to believe, that the Church, when ſhe Judges according to this Rule or the Word of God, does not onely not err, but that ſhe alſo cannot err.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is: that they are bound (as well as we) to believe that the Church of God, deciding controverſies of Faith, does judge according to the true ſence of the Word of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, upon the matter, it is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this very ſence that ſhe gives Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Parties who give it a different ſence, and who are oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43578:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>under pain of being Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks; as their Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> has poſitively declared.</p>
               <p>From hence follows, by neceſſary conſequence, according to their own Principles, that they are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, with us, that the True Church of Jeſus; Chriſt is infallible in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe judicially pronounces touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of Faith.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I think there can now be no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is ſufficient, that the Synod, which, in theſe Gentlemens opinion, repreſents the True Church, is lawful judge in this caſe, as the Synod is ſelf declares, obliging them in Confidence to adhere to and obey the Deciſions made therein.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43578:48"/>but one only Church. To this Church then it does belong to determine what our Bleſſed Saviour did reveale in his Holy Word, whenſoever there is any cauſe of doubt, in ſuch Conteſts as do ariſe; and what ſhe defines, what ſhe declares in the caſe, whatever former times did believe, it now to be held as matter of Faith.</p>
               <p n="15">15. As Proteſtants do acknowledge this Verity, as I have made it appear, ſo do we alſo moſt willingly ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and intirely profeſs that the holy Church is lawful Judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and that (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes) addreſſes are to be made to her, upon difference of Opinions, that we may learn what the Son of God revealed unto his Apoſtles; that is, what is the true meaning of Holy Scripture, and what Conſequences are to be drawn from thoſe Principles.

                  </gap> glorious title of <hi>Mother of God,</hi> which is the ground of all her other Priviledges. They were ſatisfied to aſcertain that true ſource or fountain of all her greatneſs fortifying it by Scripture and Apoſtolick Tradition, without regarding to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate further into that ſuite or train of other priviledges which did accompany that one great prerogative; or examining particularly, whether it were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by a legall enſequence flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that Principle, that ſhe was preſerved at the firſt inſtant of her being, from Original ſin.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43578:49"/>exempt from that ſtain; neither was the contrary in their Creed. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not ſo much as thought upon.</p>
               <p>At another time it has been thought good to employ many ſerious-thoughts upon this ſubject, and to ſearch more narrowly into the buſineſs. Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts have riſen about it. Whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lames have been written by Learned men, who have produced ſtrong and clear teſtimonies out of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prures for it, and have endeavoured to derive it from the very Fountain of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Doctrine, by the way of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

From whence is eaſily concluded, that, for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an exact rational diſcourſe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, it is neceſſary to avoid theſe two extremes, which a looſe kind of reaſoning is apt enough to fall into. The firſt is; <hi>That this has not alwayes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43578:51"/>been believed, therefore it is not now to be believed.</hi> The ſecond: <hi>This is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that this way of reaſoning is very ſalk and erroneous.</p>
               <p>Here then is the reaſon why, when there happens a Conteſt between two Parties of the ſame Church (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alwayes the true Church, as we ſhall by and by ſhew) it is not alwayes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we ſearch narrowly into the doctrine of Antiquity, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering what was held in thoſe dayes concerning the matter in Diſpute: It ſuffices for ending all debates, that we know what the Church (having taken full cogniſance of the matter) ſhall have determined by a ſolemn judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sentence according to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall form and method. What ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves in ſuch occurrences according to the Word of God, the true meaning whereof ſhe faithfully gives us, is to be received as matter of Faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were beforehand known, or not known to be ſo. And the contrary is an Error, which we are obliged, with

Chriſtians were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſtructed how the Body and Blood of our bleſſed Saviour are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament, not locally and ſubſtantially but myſtically; and that they are received by us, not with the mouth of fleſh, but by the operation of faith, ſo that in thoſe times they had a clear and diſtinct knowledge of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Abſence. Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> on the contrary, maintain'd ſtifly in his chiee Tracts, and gives us hopes to make is appear in a fourth, by an inquiry into the Fathers of the ſix firſt Ages, that they had a knowledge and a clear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct belief of the Real Preſence.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43578:53"/>And now again Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> evers, and poſitively proves in the whole ſixth Book of his laſt Work, that that time never was, and that there alwayes ought to have been in the Church a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlinct belief either of Real Preſence or Abſence.</p>
               <p>I have already told you, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and intended, throughout all this my little Treatiſe, to hold off from all Diſputes, and that my meaning was only to ſtep quietly aſide, that I might not be ſtopt upon the way by meeting ſome body who might be reſolv'd to Diſpute the paſſage with me.

We cannot deny but they have compoſed, and are ſtill compoſing great Volumes for drawing unto their Party, and the appoſing againſt us thoſe very Fathers whom we alledge againſt them; and that what we ſay of their Objections and Authors, they pretend, at leaſt, a right to ſay againſt ours. For my part I am reſolved to bring no action in the caſe. But I muſt deſire them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to deal like honeſt men, and ſuch as would not forfeit common ſenſe, for that ingenuity and fair dealing which becomes perſons of Honour, even

I am very confident they ſhall need but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change perſons to make the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in the ſelf ſame terms, on out behalf. In a word, let them reflect, that we do anſwer the places by them alledged, and that they find themſelves often enough in ſome trouble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity to give a ſatisfactory anſwer to ours. Let it then be left uncertain, for the preſent, to which ſide the Fathers of the Primitive times do incline. I am contented, at preſent, to endure patiently that you be not of my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the ſence and meaning which I really think ought to be given to the words of theſe Holy Fathers.

                  </note> that as by force of imagination (which modells the ſound, and determines it to the expreſſion it fancies) we make the Bells ſpeak what we liſt; even ſo in citing and alledging the Fathers, we make them ſay what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have a mind they ſhould have ſaid: and it is the reſolution of drawing them to our ſide, which determines their ſayings to a particular pretended ſenſe or meaning. I require then of you, for the preſent, that you reſt upon what was ſaid, on this ſubject, by that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter who was ſo long and ſo faithful a Servant to the Party.

               <p>And now, in caſe the Fathers by you cited, ſhould not be found to have ſo poſitively mentioned the Real Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as you pretend they have done, and we deny, you would not be upon much worſe terms, as to the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: Becauſe, according to you, the Fathers are not the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Claude,</hi> or any of his Party, will think fit to Diſpute this Point with us. For if they object Fathers againſt us, it is nor than (according to their Principle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. As to the ſecond thing in Conteſt, to wit: Whether there ever was a time in the Church, wherein there was but a confuſed kind of knowledge touching this Myſtery, without reflexion upon either Real Preſence or Real Abſence; Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> proves in one whole Book, that this could not be. And for mine own part, I confeſs unto him, that if he had none elſe to deal with beſides my ſelf, he ſhould not at all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed to give himſelf any further trouble of arguing the buſineſs, for I am abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of his perſwaſion: Nay, (I'll add further) ſhould make a ſcruple in Conſcience to refuſe my conſent to ſo rational and well-grounded an aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But (by misfortune) Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> is not of my humour, and will not yield the leaſt in a point where he imagins he has ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: and which he ſeems reſolved to make good to the very laſt. Behold why I am more than half perſwaded to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43578:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>ield up ſomething of that right which I might ſo juſtly claim; and this for peace and quietneſs ſake, and that I may not be engaged in a Diſpute, which I have reſolved to decline as much as may be. Let us then frankly grant what he demands, although we are far enough from agreeing with him upon the matter. Let us not conteſt with him about a Point, which we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with, without any great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let him have full ſcope to fancy to himſelf ſuch an obſcure dark ſeaſon of confuſed knowledge. Let that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of his own brain paſs for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; and that Chriſtians actually (as he will have it) were, at that time, in a ſtate of ignorance and obſcurity. I am contented to yield ſo far for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>And now, by way of one little peaceable digreſſion more.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I will grant moreoever, that this great Myſtery has not at all times been examined to the bottom; and that men did not employ themſelves ſo much in the diſcuſſion of this, as of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Points. The Fathers indeed have not written ſuch large Treatiſes of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:43578:57"/>as afterwards were written, and as themſelves have written concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Myſteries, which they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to maintain againſt thoſe who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them.</p>
               <p>All the Hereſies of thoſe dayes, which interrupted the peace of the Church, were chiefly concerning the moſt Bleſſed Trinity, concerning the Divinity and Incarnation the Word E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. They were at peace and quiet concerning the moſt Holy Euchariſt. It was not at all queſtioned by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks of thoſe dayes. The hour for that was not yet come. Here you have the reaſon why the Holy Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted chiefly upon the defence of ſuch Myſteries as were then queſtioned or oppoſed. It was upon thoſe occaſions they compiled thoſe great Works of theirs, with ſo much exactneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and clearing many particular Points, which were not much looked upon before thoſe Conteſts were raiſed in the Church upon different occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Without queſtion, there can be no great difficulty to agree, that the ſame has happened in the ſubject of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43578:58"/>Euchariſt. That there was a time; when men did not ſet themſelves to Write purpoſely of the depth of the great Myſtery, as they did of ſome others about which mens wits were at work by occaſion of ſome Propoſitions which had cauſed ſome diſturbance. There has been another time, when men did upon deſign, fall a writing more at large, for the explicating, not only the nature of this Sacrament, but alſo of the Myſteries contained therein.

               <p>For, in fine, Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> will have it, that people had for ſome time, only a coufuſed kind of knowledge, without poſitively believing or reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Real Preſence or Real Abſence; That <hi>Paſcaſius</hi> was the firſt who took upon him to propoſe diſtinctly the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Real Preſence, by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, explication, and confirmation of the Myſtery: that notwithſtanding

Every one pretended to have them on their ſides, and boaſted of Antiquity, which they would needs have to ſtand for them. Each Party maintained that their Opinion had the true marks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and that ſuch had been the Belief of former Ages.

                  </gap>in Corollaries which follow, out of what ſeems already agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When we are of a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Church, which is preſuppoſed to be the True one, we are bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that an Aſſembly of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſors of that Church, which is made by publick Authority according to Rule and Cuſtome, does repreſent the ſaid Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That that Church, of which the firſt Conteſtors were Members (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one Party ſeparated themſelves,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43578:61"/>upon their condemnation) was the true Church; becauſe ſhe was the onely Church, before ſeparation made. It cannot then be queſtioned, both Patties muſt of neceſſity be agreed upon it, but that ſhe being the onely Church owned by both Parties, was alſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, at that time, even in their own opinions, the True Church and the Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it belongs to this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly repreſenting this Church, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all Differences and Conteſts which may ariſe in any matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That particular perſons who argue <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi> concerning the Point in Conteſt of what quality ſoever they be, and thoſe who take part with one or other ſide for the upholding either, are the Parties Conteſting; and as ſuch, and under that notion, cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Church, which is Judge in the caſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That they, as all others, are bound to ſubmit to the Deciſions of the ſaid Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That if they refuſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſeparate themſelves from her,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43578:61"/>framing another independent Body and Community by themſelves, they are declared rebells and Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>And finally, That thoſe who adhere unto them, whether preſently, or a long time after, are guilty of the ſame crime.</p>
               <p>I think there is nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and certain, than what I have now propoſed. Otherwiſe the Church, which Jeſus Chriſt, who is the God of Order, has eſtabliſhed with ſo much Wiſdom (He who is Wiſdom it ſelf) would prove a meer <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Confuſion of all things, where there never were any diſtinction to be made between good and bad, true and falſe; ſince it would be in the power of every one, with the aſſiſtance of a Party, to make himſelf at his pleaſure, Judge and Church, and any thing, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that paſs for Truth, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as a notorious falſhood.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In Civil Communities there are alwayes Courts of Juſtice, which have received full Authority to Judge of Cauſes and Actions between particular perſons. When there happens a Sure at Law between two, be they of what
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43578:62"/>quality and condition they will, (even members of the Court it ſelf) they are no other than Parties Conteſting; Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff and Defendant. They muſt alſo have their Solicitors, their Attournies, and their Counſil to Plead for them; but it is the Judge's buſineſs to give Sentence. And when Sentence is once given, if he who was caſt ſhould ſlight the Decree of the Court, and be ſo bold as to ſay, that he owns it not as legal, nor the Court as lawful Judges; and that it is He and his Solicitors, and Council, and thoſe who are his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who conſtitute a true Court and Seat of Juſtice: I think he would be taken for no better than a Rebel and as Out-law, or one that were not in his right wits. And thoſe who, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after, ſhould dare to ſay, that he had reaſon to do as he did, would be thought to have as little judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reaſon as he.</p>
               <p>Now can it be imagined, that God would permit ſuch an irregularity, ſuch a fearful diſorder in the Government of his Church? He has been pleaſed to give Power and Authority to an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Paſtors, who are the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43578:62"/>of his Church, to end all Conteſts in matters of Faith, in ſuch manner as we have already ſeen. It is one, this or that may be held or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, before Judgement given, as any one with his Party may think fit. But when the Decree is once paſſed, and it comes to be defined by this Church, or Repreſentative of the Church, what is to be believed concerning the Point controverted, he who has loſt the cauſe (be he who he will) having, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to ſuch definition, owned that Church to be the True one, muſt not, nor cannot now ſay, that it is not the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, but that it is he himſef, his followers and Diſciples who do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and in reality conſtitute the True Church. He who uſes this language, and thoſe who take part with him, in, and at what time ſoever it does happen, can be held for no other than true Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This is clearly to be ſeen in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory; and Proteſtants themſelves will, without difficulty, grant it, as they have already acknowledged it, and ſolemnly profeſſed it in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43578:63"/>of <hi>Dort.</hi> The Primitive Church was made up of Jews and Gentile who had, received the Holy Goſpel. It happened, as it is recounted in the 15. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that ſome of thoſe, who had been converted from Judaiſme, coming to <hi>Antioch</hi> taught this Doctrine: That if thoſe who were of Gentils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians were not Circumciſed, according to the Cuſtome of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, they could not be ſaved. There fell to be a great Conteſt, and a great diſturbance in the Church about the matter; St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Barnaby</hi> ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, oppoſing that Opinion: and others maintaining it with a great deal of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs. For the compoſing the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it was thought fit to ſend theſe two Saints, and ſome of thoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary perſwaſion, to the Apoſtles and Prieſts at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to propoſe unto them the difficulty. They failed not in the performance of their charge, S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Barnabas</hi> relating unto them the favours which it had pleaſed God to, ſhew to the Gentils by help of their Miniſtery, without the aſſiſtance of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and thoſe others (eſpecially ſome of the Phariſees who
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43578:63"/>had been Convertedo) urging very hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">Surrexerunt quidam de hereſi Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeorum qui crediderunt, dicentes, quia oportet circuncidi eos, &amp;c.</note> that it was neceſſary to oblige them to be Circumciſed; and to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in its full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Upon this the Apoſtles aſſembled a Council, at which all thoſe of chiefeſt note were ſummoned to be preſent, for the ſerious examination of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And having weighed the Reaſons on both ſides at a large Conference,
<note place="margin">Convenerunt Apoſtoli &amp; Seniores &amp;c. Cum autem magna con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitio fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, &amp;c.</note> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> having firſt declared himſelf upon the Point, and being ſeconded by St. <hi>Iames,</hi> with the general conſent of the Holy Aſſembly, there paſſed a Decree, which was received by the whole Church, in which was defined and declared (with the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt who inſpired them for the underſtanding Scripture) that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was not at all neceſſary for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<note place="margin">Viſum eſt Spiritui ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto &amp; nobis &amp;c.</note> as it had formerly been during the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was now to give place to the Law of Jeſus Chriſt. The buſineſs being thus concluded, this Doctrine became a Point of Faith, and thoſe of the Phariſees who remained ſtill obſtinate in their opinion, and thoſe others who took part with them, ſtill
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43578:64"/>preſſing for a conformity with the Jews, were now indeed true Phariſees in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; that is to ſay, people cut of from the True Church, however they pretended that ſhe was onely in them and their Party.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The ſame may be ſaid of other Councils, which have been afterwards held according to the example of that one, which is the Model of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Before the Hereſie of <hi>Arius</hi> there was no ſpeech of Conſubſtantiation. That wicked Prieſt having dared to teach, that The Bleſſed Word, though Son of God, was not of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Father, but onely like unto him; found many paſſionate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of his doctrine even among the Biſhops, who grounded themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome paſſages of Holy Writ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which there aroſe a moſt deſperate Diſpute in the Church, which cauſed a general diſturbance to the peace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For the ſetling whereof, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting mens Spirits in one and the ſame Doctrine, the great Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was called, which did define: <hi>that The Word was Conſubstantial with the Father;</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:43578:64"/>which was alſo inſerted in the Symbol or Creed. When this was done, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that many Biſhops, even of thoſe who had aſſiſted at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, remained ſtill of the Opinion of <hi>Arius,</hi> and had made a ſtrong and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Party, who ſtiled themſelves the True Church, and called Councils amongſt themſelves: they are ſtill held, and Proteſtants (generally) do even at this day, hold them for Hereticks, and all thoſe who, after ſo many Ages, have followed that Sect, are treated with the ſame ſtile by them.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> of the <hi>Nestorians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Syn. Conſt. Syn. Epheſ. Sy. Chalced. VI. Synod.</note> of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,</hi> of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> and the like, who ſtand condemned in other Councils. For although after their condemnations, they proteſted that they were the True Church, ſlighting the Councils which had Condemned their Opinions, yet have they alwayes been accounted Hereticks, and are ſo at this time by Proteſtants themſelves. And now, if after they had rejected and condemned the Articles of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in their Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned perſons ſhould have made a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43578:65"/>wilful ſeparation from them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves new Proteſtants, by a new Proteſtation: that according to, and in conformity with Holy Scripture, which they onely relyed upon, their Doctrine was purely Orthodox, and that they were the true Church: it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they would have either heartily contemned their raſhneſs, or commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated their extreme folly. And if they had continued refractory and obſtinate in their reſolution, they would have cut them off as corrupt members from the Body of their pretended Reformed Church.</p>
               <p>And this is not to be wondered at; becauſe in this they are agreed, as well as we; That an Aſſembly of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors convocated by Authority repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents that Church of which thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were at Debate, are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and is acknowledged by them to be the True Church, becauſe the only Church before Separation; and that it belongs to her to end all Differences: it not being in the power of the conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to refuſe ſubmiſſion to her Decrees, or to fall off from her, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the true Church, at a leſs rate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43578:65"/>then being eſteemed Schiſmaticks, and people that proceed very irrational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>This being ſo ſolidly grounded and ſetled by mutual conſent it ſeems to me we are now in a very ready way to end all our quarrells, and reunite our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, by an application of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable maxime unto the matter in hand, according to the Principles of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> himſelf. For he will needs have it, as we have already taken notice (and in this very knack it is that conſiſts the great Secret of the change he ſo ſtrongly fancies) that there was a time, when the True Church had but a confuſed knowledge of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, without ſo much as dreaming of a Real Preſence or Real Abſence.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who firſt took upon them, as he ſayes, to maintain a Real Preſence, were of that Church, and thoſe who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, were alſo of the ſame Church; becauſe before Sentence given in the caſe, the Church, which was fallen into that confuſed knowledg, had not yet reſolved which, diſtinctly and poſitively, Preſence or Abſence, was of obligation to be believed; and conſequently, of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43578:66"/>what belief ſoever any one, for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, was, there was no ſeparation from her made or intended.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Debates and Diſputes increaſed confiderably, and broke out at length into very great heats and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which forced the ſaid Church to call an Aſſembly of her Paſtors, who were her Repreſentatives, for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deciding a Point of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Behold us now in the very ſame conjuncture of things, and upon the ſelf-ſame terms with the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is very certain, that that Church in which the followers of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſius</hi> were, and thoſe, who, according to Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> oppoſed his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, held no Council in the ninth or tenth Age, wherein this difference was decided in favour of a Real Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. There is not any one of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who ſo much as pretends to this advantage againſt us. I am alſo ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there was none during that time, which did conclude the buſineſs, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Doctrine of Real Preſence. We can onely infer from hence, that the Church having not, as yet, declared for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43578:66"/>either ſide, was in the ſame ſtate and condition, ſhe then was in, when both Parties acknowledged her for the True Church. And even this gives us ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to underſtand, that thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes (if there were any) concerning the Doctrine of <hi>Paſcaſius,</hi> were not then come to any great height or heat; ſince the Church in which the Parties were, did not, as yet, take any notice of them. And certainly it is no eaſie matter to make it out, that there was any conſiderable Conteſt concerning this ſubject during the time of the tenth Age. But when, in the eleventh Age thoſe who appeared in oppoſition to this Doctrine, made ſo much ſtir and noiſe, as to oblige the Church to prevent the miſchief by a ſeaſonable and ſolemn Judgement; then was it, that this ſame Church, which, before ſhe declared her ſelf, was owned for, and in reality was lawful Judge in the caſe, did not omit to call a Canonical Council for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding the matter. And (which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable) never did hold a more ſolemn one, nor ever did ſhe expreſſe her ſelf more clearly and more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerning any ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:43578:67"/>For when <hi>Berringarius:</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Angiers,</hi> (who had alſo wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gained <hi>Bruno</hi> Biſhop of the ſame Church unto his Party) began to take up, and engage for the Doctrine of <hi>Iohn Scotus</hi> or <hi>Bertram</hi> (which at the firſt had made no great noiſe) and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, with a great deal of vapouring and buſle, againſt the Real Preſence, two Councils were held in one year,

               <p>About ſome five years after,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1056"/> another Council was held at <hi>Tours,</hi> where <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> himſelf appeared, to give an account of his Doctrine, which was examined in his preſence, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Decree made againſt it, to which he ſubſcribed with his own hand, abjuring his Error, and promiſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der oath never to defend it more.</p>

               <p>But he being of a moſt unſetled ſpirit, and finding much difficulty to quit the honour of being Head of a Party, which was highly agreeable to his ambitious humour, quickly began again to inſtruct his Schollers in the old way, and that he might make them the more ſure to him, had the boldneſs to write againſt that very <hi>Formula</hi> which himſelf had ſigned with his own hand.</p>
               <p>This was the cauſe, that,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1079"/> twenty years after, another Council was called at <hi>Rome,</hi> where this poor Relapſed creature, being now about fourſcore years old, did again ask pardon for that

Our Brethren of the Reformed Church, will here, peradventure, tell me, that they do, by no means, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the True Church, as <hi>Berengarius</hi> did, and that they have no intention to follow him in obeying her Decrees, as that Arch-deacon did. I did foreſee well enough that this might be objected by them, to give me occaſion to fall into Diſpute. But this ſnare is eaſily avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by telling them, that this is not our buſineſs for the preſent. It is not now our queſtion, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have yet at this day all the Marks of the True Church: whether ſhe be the Holy City of God, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Babylon, being fallen into an horrid confuſion and corruption of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. They may, if they pleaſe, find wherewithal to ſatisfie themſelves in this Point, in thoſe Doctors who have treated of Controverſies, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in that great Work of the great Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> who has ſcarce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43578:70"/>any thing which might be ſaid upon this Subject. And, conſequently, I think it were not hard, by very good reaſons and motives, to ſhew theſe Gentlemen, that they have done them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no great right in ſeparating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from her. But this being a Point which may afford matter of Diſpute for all ſuch as are in the humour to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with any thing which is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their fancy: I have taken ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care to avoid it, and to ſay nothing of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> We ſpeak here onely of that Church, of which, thoſe, who firſt began the debate, were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, before ſhe had determined any thing on either ſide. Whether this Church were the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerns us not at all; ſo we be agreed in this, that it was the True Church at that time. I have need of no more. I will have nothing at preſent, but what Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> pleaſes to afford me.</p>
               <p>I will enter, with him, upon the ninth Age, when the True Church, after her <hi>good dayes,</hi> which laſted eight hundred years, found her ſelf, I know not how, in a confuſion of knowledge. After
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43578:70"/>which, ſome there were, who monti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a Real Preſence; others oppoſed it, ſtill remaining joyntly together in the ſame Church, before they ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a refuſal of obedience to her Decrees. Hereupon the Diſpute grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hotter and hotter, the Church gives Sentence. That Church, I mean, whereof the two Parties conteſting are members: which Church is the True one, becauſe the onely one before ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made for the conſtituting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church apart; and which Church alſo has full power to end all Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, ſo as to oblige to a ſubmiſſion to her Decrees. Behold here what is preciſely required, for the concluding all I pretend to, which I ſhall now endeavour to make out.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Let us then now come to reunite all the parts of this Diſcourſe, that we may make it up with the conſent and agreement of Monſieur <hi>Claude.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here, people who are of the ſame Church with us, which Church, even according to himſelf, is the true Church there being but one in the world for them and us too at ſuch time as all, according to him, were yet in that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43578:71"/>confuſion of knowledge.</p>
               <p>Some, as he tells us, think good to propoſe a Real Preſence: Others op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; and ſtand for an Abſence. Here you have the Parties conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>When the Diſpute grows hot and makes too much noiſe, a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is held, which repreſents this Church, and which upon the emergency of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, as we are agreed, has power to determine what is to be believed as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith, even although there was a general ignorance of it before.</p>
               <p>When the Decree is paſſed, thoſe who are caſt, and who before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation were of the ſame Church, muſt not ſay that ſhe is unchurched, and that it is they themſelves who now make up the Church, under pain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held, not onely Schiſmaticks, but alſo very extravagant fantaſtical perſons. And thoſe who follow them after this, and declare for them, at what time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, become fully as criminal as thoſe who firſt ſeparated themſelves from the Church in ſo unreaſonable and ſo unjuſtifiable a manner.</p>
               <p>This Aſſembly or Repreſentative,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43578:71"/>having examined the proofs and reaſons on both ſides, and conſulted with the Holy Scriptures, which are the Rule of Faith, has often declared, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a Preſence and a ſubſtantial Change are to be believed; and has condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as an Hereſie, that opinion which ſtands for Real Abſence.</p>
               <p>Of all that I have now ſaid, I cannot imagin any one Point, which can be call'd in queſtion, as I have ſtated the buſineſs. And I think I have made it appear by the very words and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> himſelf, that he is bound to agree with me in every particular; ſince by following his own conduct, we find our ſelves exactly and preciſely in the ſtate and condition of the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> In the mean time thoſe who firſt ſtood for a Real Abſence, againſt thoſe who propoſed a Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when they ſaw themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by that Church of which they were, and which before their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, was to all intents and purpoſes, the real True Church, as we are agreed, undertake to ſay, that ſhe is not ſo, and that they onely, who maintain what ſhe condemns, do conſtitute the True Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:43578:72"/>Now, according to the Principles a greed upon, I cannot diſcover how they can avoid being held Schiſmaticks. And, by unavoidable conſequence, all thoſe who have taken part with them theſe five hundred years, muſt needs be ſubject to the ſame cenſure. It being certain that they joyn with thoſe, who ſeparated themſelves from the True Church of Chriſt, for no other reaſon, but becauſe they found themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by her.</p>
               <p>It is true that that Church which is acknowledged to have been at that time the True Church, was indeed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church. But what follows from thence, according to the Principles agreed upon, but that we muſt conclude for Her, all that has been ſaid in behalf of the True Church, even by the conſent of our adverſaries themſelves. And that thoſe who were of that Church, before they withdrew themſelves, upon that Judgement ſhe gave againſt them, could not in reaſon and ſuffice, ſay, that ſhe did now ceaſe to be the True Church, and that ſhe miſunderſtood the meaning of Holy Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſhe being the True
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43578:72"/>Church, as themſelves grant, before this happened 'twas ſhe that was Judge thereof, according to the Decree of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and not they, who (according to the ſame Synod) were bound to ſubmit to her Judgement, and to hold that for the true ſence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which ſhe followed in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions.</p>
               <p>All this is ſo clearly proved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture of any proofs by way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation, that I think I ſhall do well to ſtop here, without pretending any further, that I may peaceably draw thoſe conſequences which this great Principle affords us.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Conſequences which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow from this Principle, by a due application thereof.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IN the ſecond Chapter you may have ſeen, how the True Church when conteſts do ariſe, has power to decide them according to the Word of God, and to propoſe that unto Chriſtians as matter of Faith, which, antecedently to ſuch deciſion, they were not obliged to believe, becauſe it was not clearly and diſtinctly known, but remained as yet involved in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and confuſed knowledge.</p>
               <p>In the third Chapter we did apply that uncontroulable Principle unto the ſubject of the Holy Euchariſt, and have clearly ſhewed, that the Church of which the firſt conteſtors then were, and which being the onely Church, before ſeparation made by one of the Parties,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43578:73"/>was alſo the True Church, did decide this matter, according to method and Rule, in favour of the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>From theſe two Verities thus eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, even without Diſpute, and by-wayes, we were all the way agreed upon (taking along with us the thoughts of Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> and allowing him whatſoever he was pleaſed to ask) it will not be hard (in this Chapter) to to draw ſome conſequences which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves unto us, and which it is impoſſible not to diſcover, how little ſoever we deſire to reflect upon what we have fairly and candidly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For firſt, who does not ſee, that it is neceſſarily inferred from thence, that although the Real Preſence had not been believed before the tenth Age, (which notwithſtanding is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake) yet we are now obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: Becauſe the True Church of which the firſt Conteſting Parties were members, and before their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, acknowledged her for ſuch, has put an end to the quarrel, giving Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for, and propoſing as matter of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43578:74"/>Faith, the ſaid Real Preſence.</p>
               <p>Moreover that thoſe firſt Abettors of a Real Abſence, by refuſing to ſubmit to her Judgement, became Schiſmaticks; and that all thoſe who declared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for that Faction, are as faulty, and in the ſame crime with them. I do abſolutely believe, with the Authour of <hi>The Perpetuity,</hi> &amp;c. that, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome circumſtances and certain matters of fact, which cannot be denied, it was morally impoſſible that ſuch an inſenſible change ſhould have been made, by paſſing imperce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibly from a belief, which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have been of a Real Abſence to that which we now have of a Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But in caſe ſuch a change was made, not by way of negation, but of Addition, paſſing, from an obſcure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed kind of knowledge, to a diſtinct poſitive Belief of the Real Preſence, propoſed for the lucidation or clearing this great Myſterie (in ſuch manner as Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> is pleaſed ſubtily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to imagin) yet the obligation of believing it would ſtill ſubſiſt and ſtand in force. Becauſe the ſame Church, of which the Parties, who were firſt in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43578:74"/>Diſpute about this matter, were lawful ſubjects, having heard and examined their Reaſons, did judge, according to Rule, that it was of Faith.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore now lawful to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe who revolted againſt their Mother Church: for the ſame cauſe that Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> will, without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, freely grant, that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Conſcience, to ſide and take part with the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> who would by no means receive the Decree and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church they lived in, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two wills and operations in Chriſt. On the contrary I am ſure he does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teive and reverence that Doctrine as an apputtenance of faith, although here was alſo a change in the ſame manner (by way of Addition) in the belief of the Church; and that this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wills and operations was not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, clearly and diſtinctly known.</p>
               <p>Some body, perchance, may here tell me, that, for this very reaſon, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of theſe dayes ought to ſtick to the deciſions of their Church, in matters conteſted between them and us, becauſe they own her for the True Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:43578:75"/>But I think it is not at all hard to diſcover a great difference. For making up to the head or ſource of the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall find thoſe who firſt raiſed the doubt, and brought theſe Points in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to debate, were of the ſame Church, which was accordingly the True, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the onely Church, and owned for ſuch by both Parties, before ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her ſelf upon the matter in diſpute, which without trouble, we are agreed upon with Monſieur <hi>Claude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The caſe is not here ſo. Becauſe we who are at Diſpute with Proteſtants, are not of the ſame Church with them, and ſo are not within the limits of thy maxime, which has with mutual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, been eſtabliſhed and received. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they having taken part with thoſe who at that time revolted from the True Church, becauſe they would not obey her Decrees made by Canonical Judgement; it is manifeſt that their Community, is but a falſe and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Church according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples received from them in the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, the Church, before ſhe gives Sentence upon any Point propoſed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43578:75"/>examining it by Scripture and real Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and for the better underſtanding them, ſearching into the Sentences of the Ancient Holy Fathers, endeavouring thus to reaſcend unto the Apoſtles themſelves; we are from hence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that, ſhe being inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, who has promiſed to teach her all Truths, as occaſions require, what ſhe defines is alwayes conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to Scripture and Tradition.</p>
               <p>Thus it is that we are to learn, by her definitions, what is the true meaning or ſence of Scripture, when there is place for doubting thereof.</p>
               <p>Before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> there were moſt deſperate Diſputes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain paſſages of Scripture, which the followers of <hi>Arius</hi> alledged for the upholding their upſtart doctrine. As for example, about that in the fifth of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> where our Bleſſed Saviour ſays that <hi>his Father is greater than he:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quia Pater major me eſt,</hi> Joh. 5.</note> from whence they inferred, that he was not of the ſame Subſtance. The others, on the contrary, maintained, that this paſſage was to be underſtood, of the Son of God conſidered according to Humane nature, which places him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43578:76"/>below the Father, and makes him ſubmit even to the death of the Croſs; but not according to his Divine nature, which renders him equal, and makes them both to be of one and the ſame Subſtance. Theſe two ſence were hotly maintained by the two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, each of them challenging the true ſence or meaning of Scripture on their ſide. But when the Council, having throughly examined this important que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, had defined the <hi>Conſubſtantiality</hi> of The Word, making uſe of a terme, which is not found in Holy Writ, for the clearer expreſſing that Truth which ſhe diſcovered there; then was there no more time nor place to doubt what was the lawful ſence thereof, and there aroſe an obligation (through this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition) of believing that that was the true one, which was given by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines vvho oppoſed the faction of the <hi>Arians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame is certainly to be ſaid upon this occaſion; eſpecially our preſent cauſe being upon much better termy, and more ſtrongly provided for by the evidence of the Texts alledged for it. When at firſt the popoſition vvas made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43578:76"/>the Real Preſence, in the time of <hi>Paſcaſius</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> pretends) and preſently oppoſition was made, as he is pleaſed to ſay (for at preſent we will aſſume nothing but of his free gift) there happened a great Conteſt, which grew yet much greater, after ſome time, concerning the true ſence of thoſe words: <hi>This is my Body:</hi> One ſide maintaining, that they did expreſs a Real Preſence; and the other pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they onely ſignified, that that which our Bleſſed Saviour gave unto his Apoſtles, <hi>repreſented his Body.</hi> Both parties, as we have often taken notice, were of the ſame Church, which they acknowledged and owned to be the True Church. This Church having throughly examined the buſineſs in her General Councils, defines a Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſubſtantial change, even to the making uſe of the word <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> which is not literally found in the Goſpel, for the expreſſing more clearly that verity which ſhe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therein, and for the efficacious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing any other ſence which might be given to thoſe words, <hi>This is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> From that time forward it was
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43578:77"/>no longer lawful to doubt of the ſence of them.</p>
               <p>And by this definition, men ſtood obliged to believe, that they were to be underſtood plainly and literally, not metaphorically. When there is really place of doubt, it is not for particular perſons, who are at ſtrife, to determine the ſence of the Text in Diſpute, but this belongs properly to the Church, which is Judge in the caſe. For elſe there could never be any end of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, and God ſhould not have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with any certain means for the finding out Truth, when doubts do ariſe concerning Holy Scripture, nor, conſequently, for the clearing thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates which may ariſe in matters of Religion. Which certainly would be the ſame, as to ſay, that he had not provided for the Government, quiet and peace of his Church.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43578:77"/>to regulate the ſence we are to give to Holy Scripture, by that mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the holy Church gives it.

               <p>The ſame, in proportion, is to be ſaid of the paſſages of Holy Fathers. For it being the cuſtome and order of the Church to adviſe with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Judgement ſhe is to give; regularly ſpeaking, we ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them according to her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whenever theſe ariſes a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43578:78"/>concerning the meaning of their words, which do not alwayes prove ſo very intelligible, even to the Learneder ſort of men. There is, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this difference, that as no one of thoſe Fathers in particular, is the Rule of her belief, ſo does ſhe not ſo abſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely determin by her Decrees, what is the meaning of ſuch or ſuch a paſſage of theirs (leaving it many times to our diſcuſſion) as ſhe does that of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, which ſhe permits not to be call'd in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And from hence we draw a third Concluſion; that, when in any Province or Kingdome, a difficulty does ariſe in matter of Religion, it is very uneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and prepoſto us to undertake to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it by way of Diſputation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Experience has often ſhewed, that ſuch proceedings ſerve onely to increaſe the Diviſion and render it end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; provoking high ſpirits, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them upon a pike of Honour, which permits them not to be much moved with any reaſons of an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>We muſt come quickly to that fixed and ſetled Point (I mean the Soveraign
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43578:78"/>undeclinable Judgement of the Church) in which there are two ſeveral times or ſeaſons which are, of neceſſity, to be diſtinguiſhed: <hi>that which goes before,</hi> and <hi>that which followes after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt of theſe, writing on both ſides, ſo it be without bitterneſs, with a good intent and deſign to make Truth appear, is very lawful. And then the Reaſons alledged in ſuch Writings, the Fathers who happen to be cited <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> do make (as it were) Plaintiff and Defendant, Counſil and Plea in the Court. They are the Bills and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. The Replyes and Reparties are the difficulties propoſed on both ſides. But what the Church definitively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, having taken cogniſance of, and examined things according to the Rules and proceedings of the Court, this becomes a Decree, this is Truth, this is the fixed Point we muſt ſtick to and rely upon, whether the Fathers ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted did diſtinctly believe it or no.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond of theſe times or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in caſe thoſe whoſe doctrine ſtands condemned, will not acquieſce and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Judgement, Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who are as Protectors of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43578:79"/>Canons and Definitions of the Church, have a duty incumbent upon them, to procure and exact that obedience which is due, and to endeavour the quieting and reducing ſuch turbulent ſpirits by ſuch means as they ſhall judge moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious. And, in the mean time it ſhall be lawful for the Learned to Write more vigourouſly againſt them, and to bring Scripture and Fathers (as has been practiſed by many knowing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertiſts) not by way of diſcuſſing a matter which is yet within the bounds of incertitude; but to make the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Falſity appear, and to ſhew the force of Truth, and the conformity of the Judgement of the Church with the Doctrine of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>For all other Perſons, it is much more to their purpoſe, not to meddle with, not hearken to any thing of this kind, but to ſatisfie themſelves, ſaying: <hi>This the Church has deſined, this I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, this I will ſtick cloſe unto.</hi> In my opinion this is all which ought to be propoſed to the Faithful, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Judges of Controverſies is Faith, and without giving them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to enter into Diſpute concerning
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43578:79"/>this place of Scripture and that of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers, which for the moſt part, are things beyond their reach and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.

                  </gap> ſuch manner as it has been propounded may and ought to be applyed to every particular Point controverted, that we may come to have a ready and certain ſolution thereof. For thoſe who firſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43578:80"/>oppoſed the Doctrine we now make profeſſion of, in any Article debated, either were at that time of the fame Church with thoſe whom they oppoſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Church they owned for the True Church, there being as yet no ſeparation made; or they were already diſmiſſed from her. If they were of the ſame, it is but ſeeing what that Church, by her Repreſentative, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clated concerning the matter in debate. For we are agred that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſubmit to her Judgement; ſo far as that, in caſe of contempt, it could not be lawful to take part with them, without falling, after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, into open and direct Schiſm. But if they were already divorced from her, upon any other ground, or for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other precedent cauſe, it is evident from the ſame reaſon, that they were, upon the whole matter, already true Schiſmaticks, becauſe, either they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their Predeceſſors having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been of that Church, they ought not, after legal Sentence given, to have made a Separation; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it is not lawful at this day to joyn with them, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43578:81"/>complices with them, and guilty of their revolt.</p>
               <p>This is that we call a true, ſolid and general <hi>Preſcription</hi> againſt all thoſe who contend with us. Behold here an end of the war, a concluſion of all Diſputes the bond of peace, the union of hearts and underſtandings, the certain Rule, the immovable Point, the unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Principle, and ſole abridgement of all Controverſies. What we are to believe concerning the Invocation of Saints, the veneration of holy Images, of the number of Sacraments, of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, of Grace, of Free-will, and of Juſtification. Let us not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new thoſe old quarrels, which have ſet the Chriſtian World at odds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe points. Let us not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fall a queſtioning and diſcuſſing all thoſe Texts and paſſages which have been a thouſand times mentioned, a thouſand times brought on one ſide, and as often returned on the other in a quite contrary ſence. Let us not engage our ſelves in thoſe quarrels, where the victory never appears cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe ſuch Champions are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a readineſs to charge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43578:81"/>afreſh, being never out of breath, and reſolved never to quit the field, nor lay down their arms.</p>
               <p>Behold what will ſet us all right and bring us to an agreement in a moment, putting a period to all our troubles even before they begin.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee what that Church, which was common Mother and commander of both Parties, when the war firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, has reſolv'd in each of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Here you ſhall be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover wherein true Faith conſiſts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the True Church, which in all mens opinions, has power (when the queſtion is moved) to declare what is to be believed, has judged thus and thus according to thoſe Rules, which (ſhe never failing to apply them in due manner and juſt proportion) can never be deficient. He, whoſoever he was, who refuſed obedience to that Decree, became <hi>ipſo facto</hi> a Schiſmatick. And it is no leſs evident, that all who joyn with him are in the ſame Predicament. This is that one Fundamental and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolving Point, which alone can end the quarrel: and that in the moſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner imaginable, without being
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43578:82"/>obliged to enter into further debate or diſcuſſion of the matter.</p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon, why, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this while of a True Church, (which certainly is ſomewhere or other, as all the world acknowledges) I have purpoſely omitted to ſay any thing of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or of the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pope, or of his quality or prerogatives as Head thereof. For, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly I ſhould have met with ſome rub or other, this being a Point highly conteſted between us: whereas, for my part, I was reſolved to enter into no quarrel, but to be at perfect agreement, and go on my way hand in hand with thoſe of the Proteſtant Church. For, I conceive, we have nothing elſe to do but to apply this our Rule and agreed upon Principle unto the preſent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to allow unto St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors that which the Goſpel gives him, as it is underſtood by that Church, of which we all were, when Diſputes firſt aroſe concerning that ſubject, and according to what that Church has ſet forth in thoſe great and holy Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the firſt Oecumenical Councils, which are, and ought to be reverenced
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43578:82"/>and reſpected by all who call themſelves Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I ask but this, which I think cannot be denyed me, and this alone is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured means to bring us ſpeedily to an agreement, and to cauſe a ceſſation of that lamentable diviſion which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and is ſo unfortunate to the Church; ſo pernicious to the publick good; ſo injurious to the peace and quiet of the People, and ſo fatally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the ſafety and Salvation of ſo many Perſons.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (for a concluſion) I humbly, and with my whole heart and foul beſeech our Brethren of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, in the fight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, to lay aſide that invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate prejudice they have againſt us,

As the debate never aroſe about this, ſo ſhall the deciſion of this Point never end the quarrel, nor bring peace among us. There is no body queſtions it: neither you nor we doubt the leaſt of it. And yet the feud for all that ſtill increaſes. That then which is of true importance or concern, is, to know, whether that which we call the Word of God be really ſo, or no: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the interpretation which I give or

               <p>All is not done when we have got the Rule, it muſt alſo be rightly applyed and according to art.

Is it not abſolutely neceſſary that it be ſome Judge, who has received both authority and light from God himſelf for the performing this office?

Now I beſeech you, Gentlemen, give me leave to tell you with as real a deſire of your eternal Salvation, as the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> had for that of <hi>David,</hi> when he ſpoke thoſe moving words to him, which pearc'd his heart: <hi>Tu es ille vir.</hi> Alas! Gentlemen, it is you who unfortunately are engaged in the party of thoſe firſt rebells, who forſook the Church, to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of thoſe Decrees which condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Opinions. As the Laws both Humane and Divine, right reaſon, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural underſtanding, and the order and method which your ſelves do obſerve, oblige you to acknowledge, that they were bound to ſubmit to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Church which themſelves owned to be the True one, and that they could not ſeparate from her, but by evident Schiſme: ſo is it certain, that you (after ſo many ages which have paſſed ſince their Condemnation) cannot joyn with them, following their Doctrine and proceedings, without bearing a part with them in their crime, and becoming guilty of their defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43578:86"/>Rather quit their company, wihoſe origin your ſelves condemn. Return into the boſom of that Church, from which you find the firſt Authors of that Sect could not, in Conſcience and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural equity, withdraw themſelves, as they did, upon that ſcore onely, that the Decree was not in favour of their cauſe. Do not any longer trouble your ſelves, as they do, with Diſputing, pleading, and excepting, after Sentence is once paſs'd. Allow me to ſpeak unto you in the language of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Martyr of Chriſt, and great Biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> Why do you,

            <head>An Extract of the National Synod held at <hi>Alez 1620.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>VVHereas it was propoſed unto the Synod, as neceſſary to deliberate upon ſome efficacious means for hindering the Errors of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> which had cauſed ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Low-Countreys, from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting entrance alſo into this Kingdom: The Congregation having admitted of the ſaid Propoſal as laudable, juſt and neceſſary for the peace of the Church. for preſerving purity of Doctrine, and for a ſtreighter union with all other the Reformed Churches has thought good, that as the diſtemper of the Churches of the Low-Countries puts us in mind of looking to our ſelves, ſo we ought
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43578:88"/>to follow their example, and prevent the miſchief by the ſame means by which they have expelled it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing that the National Synod of <hi>Dart</hi> convened by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, wiſe counfil, and vigilance of the moſt Illuſtrious Lords States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all the Provinces under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, at which were preſent many great Divines of the other Reformed Churches, hath been to the ſaid Low-Countries, and is found to be at this hour a moſt effectual remedy for the purging the ſaid Church, and rooting out Hereſies in the Point of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other Points thereon depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; This Congregation, after having invoked the Name of God, reſolved, That the Canons of the ſaid Council of <hi>Dort</hi> ſhould be read in full and open Synod; and recital thereof having been made accordingly, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Article ſeriouſly and attentively weighed and pondered, they were by conſent received and approved of as conformable to the Word of God, and to the Confeſſion of Faith of our Churches, deſigned and contrived with a great deal of prudence and purity;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43578:89"/>moſt proper for diſcovering and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Errors of the <hi>Arminians.</hi> For which reaſon all the Miniſters and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders deputed for this Aſſembly have ſworn and proteſted, every one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they do approve of and agree unto the ſaid Doctrine, and that they will maintain it to the utmoſt of their powers, ſo long as they have breath in their bodies. The form and tenor of which ſaid Oath, together with the names of the Deputies underwritten ſhall be annexed to the ſaid Canons and Oath. And for the rendring the ſaid Agreement more authentick, and of greater authority to the obliging all the Provinces thereby; it is ordered by the ſaid Congregation, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Article ſhall be printed and added to the Canons of the ſaid Council, and that it ſhall be read in all Provincial Synods, and Univerſities, there to be allowed, ſworn unto and ſigned by the Paſtors, Elders, and Profeſſors of the Univerſities; as alſo by all thoſe who pretend to be received into the holy Miniſtery, and Profeſſion in Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. But if any one ſhall, either in whole or in part, reject the Doctrine
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43578:89"/>conteined in, and decreed by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the ſaid Council, or ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to make oath of his conſent and approbation, it is reſolved and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſaid Congregation, that ſuch Rejecter or Refuſer ſhall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any charge or employment Eccleſiaſtical or Scholaſtical whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>

I do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo declare and proteſt, that I do reject and condemn the doctrine of the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, as making the Election of God to depend upon the will of Man, extenuating and annihilating the Grace of God, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating man, and the force of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will for the more dangerous precipitating of him; bringing in Pelagianiſme again, diſguiſing Popery, and overthrowing all

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43578:92"/>But I hope they may be perſwaded, that it is not the firſt time a <hi>French</hi> man has ſpoke good fence, though in bad Engliſh.

               </hi> to be their great and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Champion; and it muſt be granted. I think, by all, that Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> has in this late famous Conteſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf as a valiant and skilful Souldier of the Catholick Church. The ſubject of Diſpute between them is of common concern. And, perchance the ſetling of that one Point, upon ſuch grounds as my Authour, in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate peaceable way endeavours to lay down, may prove final to all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I foreſee that his Inſtance for agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Principles taken, in part, from the <hi>Council of Dort,</hi> will not be allowed by all as ſterling. 'Tis poſſible there may be ſome left who retain a

'Tis pitty Countries and Climates ſhould have an influence upon Reaſon and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, as they have upon Complexions and Conſtitutions. Now certain it is that generally among the Reformed of <hi>France,</hi> for whom this Authour chiefly deſigned his Work, the Council of <hi>Dort,</hi> and the Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Decrees thereof (as you may plainy diſcover by the annexed Extract of the Synod of <hi>Alez</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) have been, and, to this hour, are in great eſteem. And it may be ſuppoſed, both by the unanimous Votes of the ſelect Divines of all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches then in being: and by the ſolid and impregnable grounds of their proceedings, that there is a great deal of reaſon for their ſo doing: ſuch as (ſetting aſide paſſion and preingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) cannot be parllel'd by any of the diffenters.</p>
            <p>But as I muſt confeſſe my ſelf a friend of my Authors Method, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in aſſuming nothing but what his Adverſary ſeems to grant, ſo will I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43578:93"/>not make it my buſineſs to apologia: for that Council, which to ſome may ſeem to lye open to exceptions. It ſhall be ſufficient for me, to give a hint at what has paſt within our own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, much of the ſame nature; and to give occaſion to thoſe who make any queſtion of it, to ſearch into the ſeveral Parliamentary and Synodical proceedings of our own Reformed Church in late dayes; that is in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, King <hi>James</hi>'s, and King <hi>Charles</hi> his time; when the 39. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſome other Points belonging to Religion, have been advanced with as great a claim of Legiſlative Power and Definitive Authority, as any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, either of the Catholick or Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church ever challenged to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. See if you pleaſe, the very Title of the 39.

            <p>The Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. is yet more comprehenſive, as intended for the regulating all in general. By this Statute it is <hi>Enacted that no manner of Order, Act or Determination for any matter of Religion or cauſe Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, had or made by the Authority of this preſent Parliament, ſhall be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, deemed, interpreted, or adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at any time hereafter to be any He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rſie, Schiſme, or Schiſmatical Opinion: any.

            </p>
            <p>It is to be preſumed that this High Court of Parliament was very well informed that there had been more Hereſies than one in times paſt; and that they thought it very neceſſary to appoint ſome effectual means for the ſuppreſſing others which might ariſe. Thoſe means thus deliberately appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are deſervedly to be reflected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Canonical Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And here, by the way, let me intreat you to call to mind the Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Point, which I ſuppoſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43578:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>you have already peruſed in the ſecond Chapter, Sect. 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this ſmall Treatiſe; then which, I muſt needs think, nothing can be more rational, in order to the convincing a neceſſity of a further Determinative Power, either for the clearing the Scriptures themſelves to be truly Canonical; or for making out the true fence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, ſo as to render them truly and effectually uſeful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as to the reſpect and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority allowed here by Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament <hi>to the four first General Councils,</hi> it were to be wiſhed that ſome good ſolid Reaſon might be made appear, why thoſe other ſubſequent Councils, which had the ſame Promiſe of ſpecial aſſiſtance from him who was and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make his Word good, may not be ſuppoſed to have proceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame Rule of thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, defining and declaring according <hi>to the expreſs and plain words of the Canonical Scriptures:</hi> and who it is <hi>(by the expreſs and plain words of the ſaid Canonical Scriptures)</hi> who has received Commiſſion to Judge of the Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:43578:95"/>But laſtly, (which is chiefly to my preſent purpoſe) does not here an High Court of Parliament (the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative obliging Power of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>with the aſſent of the Clergy in their Convocation</hi>) aſſert and aſſume unto themſelves as abſolute an Authority of Determining matters of Faith, and declaring Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as was ever yet challenged by any Body-Politick or Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
            <p>Many other proceedings of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Canons and Conſtitutions of Synocts might be alledged, were not the matter of fact ſo obvious and well known to every one, that it acquits me of that labour. And now if all this, to a common Engliſh mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, does not ſpeak a claim of an Authority obliging all to ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conformity, I think we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to ſeek for expreſſions. And certainly, ſuppoſing what was ſuppoſed, there could be nothing more rational or conformable to thoſe firſt Councils we all ſo much receive; as alſo to the manifeſt letter of, or evident deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Holy Writ it ſelf.

            <p>This then being granted (and I think he muſt be very bold, who dares reject the Authority of ſo many eminent Perſons, or contemn their publick proceedings) I perſwade my ſelf, I need not be very ſolicitous for Inſtances drawn from the Council of <hi>Dort.</hi> Certainly we have as ſpecial and as remarkable ones neerer home for the making good an Agreement upon this great Maxithe: <hi>That there is in the Church of Chriſt (wherever that is) a Soveraign Authority obliging Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in matters of Faith to ſubmiſſion and conformity.</hi>

            <p>The Conſequence has been the chief endeavour of this ſmall Tract; And I hope it will be ſeriouſly reflected upon, how neceſſarily (not to ſay unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) the Premiſes uſher it in.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I ſee there are ſome (for what reaſons and foreſeen conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; I will not paſſe my conjecture)
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43578:96"/>who have endeavoured to find out new Gloſſes, not onely for the Scriptures, but alſo for Acts and Statutes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; Canons and Conſtitutions of Councils (even with ſeeming vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to the Lawes of the Nation and the Decrees of their own Mother-Church) telling us, that nothing is meant or intended by the ſaid Acts and Decrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but onely an obligation to <hi>exteriour Conformity</hi> and <hi>Non contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> I will ſtill adhere to my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours peceable Method, hoping they will take me for one who deſires to deal civilly, If I require no more, at preſent, for the making good what this Author pretends to. For I am very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, that this kind of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> or <hi>Non contradiction,</hi> ſuppoſed obligatory, and practiſed in due time and place (when differences firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared) would have left a much more eaſie way for compoſing and reducing unſetled and unquiet ſpirits; and would have brought them by little and little, into ſo pleaſant a path, as would have led them, in a ſhort time, into the high way of happy peace and union. For, were the liberty of that voluble
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43578:97"/>member,
<note place="margin">Jac. 3.8.</note> that <hi>Inquietum malum</hi> of the tongue (ſo apt, either out of vanity or preſumption, to break out into expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our interiour ſentiments) ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually reſtreyned, it were much to be hoped thoſe troubled and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fancies which inſect the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, would, by little and little, ſink or fall down, ſo, as to leave it to its natural clearneſs, fitted of it ſelf to receive better impreſſions either from Reaſon or juſt Authority. Not that I think any rational man, unleſs much put to his ſhifts, can in earneſt, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Negative kind of compliance to be ſufficient for attaining the end pretended to, which, I ſuppoſe, is an exteriour, at leaſt, Conformity or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity, for the avoiding diviſion and confuſion. For never was it yet heard of, nor can it poſſibly be expected, that the Index or Hand of a Watch or Clock, ſhould ſhew the right hour, for any conſiderable time, much leſs conſtantly, unleſs the inward work or wheels be in good order. Would to God there were not ſo ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this (practically certain) Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:43578:97"/>Thoſe Diviſions, Sub-diviſions, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſub-diviſions breaking into viſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, which certainly cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the lawful Iſſue of true Chriſtian Principles, do, to the eye, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that there is ſomething wanting; that this is not the way intended by him who came to bring Peace to the World, and who promiſed his conſtant Preſence for the maintaining of it to the worlds end, not by a viſible appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but inviſible aſſiſtance of that Church which he commands all to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto and obey, under ſo ſevere a penalty, as being accounted (upon default) Heathens and Publicans.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let me be ſo bold, as to deſire theſe Gentlemen, who go ſo far, at leaſt, as to think this <hi>Exteriour Conformity</hi> or <hi>Non-contradiction</hi> oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and neceſſary, to take the pains to reflect ſoberly, whether this which they do, and muſt grant, does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to make one ſtep further, and upon the ſame grounds (either of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whether Humane or Divine, or principles of reaſon; or for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary avoiding experienced inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) to allow an obedience and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43578:98"/>aſſent of an higher nature. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of Scriptures and Fathers are alledged as plauſibly for it. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, taken, either from the experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced inſufficiency of the one Cauſe; or the juſt and exact proportion of the other, to the ſo much deſired effect of peace and unity, are demonſtrable. As the inconveniences and continual diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the one Part are but too too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; ſo the ſetled quiet and comfort of Spirit, which the other conſtantly enjoyes, are experimentally beſt known to thoſe, who upon the firſt appearance of difficulties and debates, flye to the boſome, and rely upon the Judgement and Determination of the Church, owned by all who call themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to have ſome degree of Power and Authority, and the extent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not to be regulated or confined (ſhe being the Soveraign and Supreme Court of this nature) but by her own decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration onely. Demonſtrably not to be judged or regulated, in caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, by particular Parties, who (for the avoiding otherwiſe unavoidable confuſion) are themſelves by her to be regulated and judged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:43578:98"/>Now which Church this muſt needs be, is not hard to diſcover out of the foregoing Diſcourſe, wherein Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Debates are brought to their firſt riſe, when the Parties diſſenting were both, ownedly, members and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the ſame Church, and which Church, by legal Conſequence, was their lawful Judge, as being then the onely, and, by a neceſſary Sequel, the True Church, and that firm Rock, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, the Promiſe of God himſelf is upon Record, that the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail.</p>
